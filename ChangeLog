* Switched to using std::tr1::unordered_map<> instead of __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>
  which was deprecated in GCC 4.3. STL Technical Report 1 is much more
  standards compliant.
* Also added some more includes for GCC 4.3 compability.
* Removed custom specialization of hash<void*> since that is included in TR1
* Factor out all hash_map related references into a #define in util.h
  This should make it easier to port this to other STL implementations that
  don't yet include TR1.
* Added hashstr function to util.h that also depends on TR1

Tested to compile with GCC 4.2 and 4.3
