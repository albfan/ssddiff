* Switched to using std::tr1::unordered_map<> instead of __gnu_cxx::hash_map<>
which was deprecated in GCC 4.3. STL Technical Report 1 is much more standards
compliant.
* Also added some more includes for GCC 4.3 compability.
* Removed custom specialization of hash<void*> since that is included in TR1

TODO: factor out the map classes into a single header file, to allow easier
porting to other C compilers / STL implementations?
